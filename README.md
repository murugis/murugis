### Hi there my name is RoseðŸ‘‹
 Working and going to school taught me so many skills from not only how to drive but it also taught me to manage my time well. In other words, I am able to be flexible with having multiple jobs in order to find where I belong and that is my goal in life. I am currently learning Data Science at Lambda School.I love puzzles and working with data to solve today's problems is my greatest goal. 

### Languages
